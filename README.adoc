= A Drools event accumulator using the Event Correlator

== Purpose
A set of Drools rules that leverage the existing flap-detection helpers in order
to maintain a count of events received within a configurable interval and emit
an event when the count is exceeded.

== Installing
 - Enable the `Correlator` in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/services-configuration.xml`
 - copy `drools-engine.xml` to `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/`
 - copy the entire `drools-engine.d` to `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/`
 - modify the `drools-engine.xml` for your desired interval, event count, and event UEIs.
 - cross your fingers and restart OpenNMS

== Usage
As described.  The log output from drools is eaten by systemd; you can view it with `journalctl -u opennms`
